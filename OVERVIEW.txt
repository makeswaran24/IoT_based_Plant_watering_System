PROJECT 
IoT Based Plant Watering System 
Project by: MAKESWARAN K, KPR INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY 
Guided by : Dr.Prasad Joshee & Dr.Jaikumar 

OBJECTIVE OF OUR PROJECT
To  develop  a  smart  irrigation  system  that  optimizes  water  usage  by intelligently monitoring and regulating soil moisture levels,
thereby reducing water wastage and ensuring efficient water management for crop cultivation

METHODOLOGY
STEP 1:	Based on requirement of the society identify the type of plant.
STEP 2:	Collect data from plant.
STEP 3:	Transfer data to NodeMCU board.
STEP 4:	Write Arduino code for target application.
STEP 5:	Interface Arduino with Blynk application.
STEP 6:	Automatically the relay get turn on or off based on the notification

PROTOTYPE MODEL
Sensors Used: Rain drop, temperature, and soil moisture sensors monitor
conditions.
Data Display: Sensor readings are shown in the Serial Monitor for real-
time tracking.
Relay	Control:	Future	work	includes	adding	a	relay	to	automate	motor
control for irrigation.
IoT Upgrade:	Integration with cloud will enable remote monitoring and control via smartphones.
Efficient Irrigation: Ensures water is used only when necessary, reducing wastage
